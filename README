INSTALLATION

1) Create a mysql database and a user who can connect and write to it.

2) Load the MySQL database.

   mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < testswarm.sql
   mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < useragents.sql

3) Copy the ./config/config-sample.ini to ./config.ini and change the options to correspond to your MySQL database information.

4) Load the cronjob (changing the URL to point to your site).

   crontab < config/cronjob.txt 

5) Currently the server must be run in Apache (it uses a .htaccess file) and be within a VirtualHost (on its own domain or sub-domain).
